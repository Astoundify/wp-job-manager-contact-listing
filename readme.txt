Allow sites using the WP Job Manager plugin to contact listings via their favorite form builder plugin.

== Description ==

Sites using the [WP Job Manager](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-job-manager/) plugin can use any of the supported plugins and allow visitors to contact the connected application email (or resume author) directly.

**Supported Form Plugins**

* Gravity Forms
* Ninja Forms
* Contact Form 7

= Where can I use this? =

Astoundify has released two themes that are fully integrated with the WP Job Manager plugin. Check out ["Jobify"](http://themeforest.net/item/jobify-job-board-wordpress-theme/5247604?ref=Astoundify) and our WordPress Directory theme ["Listify"](http://themeforest.net/item/listify-wordpress-directory-theme/9602611?ref=Astoundify)

The plugin can also be used on any theme but no extra styling (outside the CSS that comes with the form plugins) is used.

**Video Tutorial:** https://vimeo.com/85469722/

You **must** create a *hidden* field with the following specific settings:

* **Label:** Listing ID
* **Allow field to be dynamically populated:** `{embed_post:ID}`

The Job/Resume listing must also have an email address associated with it, not a URL to a website.
